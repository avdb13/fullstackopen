  Note: the default behavior of the form element is prevented and instead a JavaScript callback is attached.

  Note: The browser executes the callback function that first adds the element to our DOM and
  sends it to the server afterwards, resetting the contents of the input element as well as
  rerendering the list of notes without reloading the page.
